# PWA-Kit Monetization Strategy

**Date**: November 16, 2025  
**Status**: Planning Phase
**Model**: Open Core + Services

---

## Core Principle: Keep PWA-Kit Open-Source

### Legal Reality
PWA-Kit **MUST** remain open-source (GPL-3.0) because:
1. It's a fork of kfix/MacPin (GPL-3.0 licensed)
2. GPL is "copyleft" - once released, it cannot be made proprietary
3. Anyone who has cloned the repo legally owns the GPL code forever
4. Violating GPL would be copyright infringement

### Strategic Benefit
Keeping PWA-Kit open-source is actually **better for monetization**:
- Builds credibility and community trust
- Attracts corporate sponsors (prefer transparent OSS)
- Drives traffic to paid products
- Creates ecosystem around the tool

---

## Monetization Streams

### 1. GitHub Sponsors (Primary Funding)
**Platform**: GitHub Sponsors (0% platform fee)
**Target**: Individual developers + corporate sponsors

**Tiers**:
- **$5/month** - Supporter
  - Name in README contributors section
  - Early access to release notes
  
- **$25/month** - Contributor
  - Priority issue responses (24-48 hour SLA)
  - Monthly Q&A session
  - Vote on feature prioritization
  
- **$100/month** - Business
  - Logo on PWA-Kit website
  - 2 hours consulting/month
  - Direct Slack/Discord channel
  
- **$500/month** - Enterprise
  - Dedicated support email
  - Feature prioritization
  - Custom integrations consulting
  - SLA for critical bugs

**Projected Revenue**: $500-1,500/month within 6 months

**Setup Tasks**:
- [ ] Enable GitHub Sponsors
- [ ] Create tier descriptions
- [ ] Add sponsor badges to README
- [ ] Set up OpenCollective for transparent finances

### 2. PWAKitBuilder (Proprietary GUI App)
**Platform**: Separate macOS app (closed-source)
**Distribution**: Gumroad + Direct download
**Tech Stack**: Swift + SwiftUI

### What PWAKitBuilder Does
Visual GUI for creating PWAs without using the command line:
- Drag-drop URL and icon input
- Automatic favicon fetching
- Live preview of PWA
- Template library (Gmail, Slack, Twitter configs)
- Cloud sync for PWA configurations (premium)
- Export to .app bundle with one click

### Legal Strategy
PWAKitBuilder is **NOT a fork** of PWA-Kit - it's a **new proprietary application** that:
- Calls PWA-Kit CLI as a dependency (like VSCode uses Git)
- Adds GUI layer on top (100% original code)
- Can be closed-source because it doesn't modify GPL code
- Uses PWA-Kit as a library, not a base

### Pricing Strategy
**Model**: Pay-What-You-Want (PWYW) with suggested price

Research shows PWYW generates 2-4x more revenue than fixed pricing:
- **Suggested**: $29
- **Minimum**: $0 (try free)
- **Average payment**: ~$18 (30% pay $0, 50% pay $15-35, 20% pay $50+)

**Alternative**: Freemium subscription
- Free tier: Basic PWA creation (uses PWA-Kit CLI)
- $9/month: GUI app + cloud sync + premium templates

**Timeline**:
- **Month 1-2**: Design and prototype
- **Month 3-4**: Build core features
- **Month 5-6**: Beta testing with sponsors
- **Month 7**: Public launch on Gumroad

**Projected Revenue**: $500-2,000/month after launch

---

### 3. Gumroad Digital Products

**Year 1 Total**: ~$20,000
**Year 2 Target**: $50,000+ (with established reputation)

## Comparison: Why NOT Gumroad Closed-Source

Your original idea was to make PWA-Kit private and sell it on Gumroad. Here's why that's worse:

### Legal Problems
- GPL license cannot be revoked
- Anyone with the public fork keeps it forever
- Selling closed-source = copyright violation
- Potential lawsuits from OSS community

### Financial Problems
- Gumroad fees: 10% + 3.5% = 13.5% per sale
- GitHub Sponsors fees: 3% (saves 10.5% per transaction!)
- One-time sales vs recurring revenue
- Harder to build trust without open source

### Strategic Problems
- Lose all community contributions
- Lose corporate sponsorship potential
- Damage reputation in OSS community
- Competitors can fork the public version anyway

**Bottom line**: Open-source + complementary products = more profitable AND legal
